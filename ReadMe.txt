For testing the code: To use the User view, create an account. To use the Admin view, username:admin password:admin

To do this first iteration of the bet&ruin project, we've done 6 tasks, which are create questions, browse questions, Sign-up, Log-in, 
create a new event and set a fee. 
We tried to do as simply as possible version of this 1st iteration. We've changed the version Juananpe, as we used a similar main menu 
aspect, just adding more options. 
Our main problem it's been that in the "Event" class the event number didn't work so we have used a 
random number creator. In the other hand, we had some problems with github, principally we had errors with the conflicts and we were not
able to solve the problems with github. Finally, setFee option was so much harder than we thought. In this option which question and which
event were selected it's been a problem for us. It also was a problem to add the fee to the database. But we finally solved those problems
by creating new atributes and saving index's of which question and which event was selected.

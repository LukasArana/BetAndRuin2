To do this second iteration of the bet&ruin project, we've created 3 new use cases: Deposit money, place a bet and view money movements,
as well as changing everything from the first sprint to JavaFX and SceneBuilder. In the process, we also updated some of the domain
classes when needed.
One of the problems we encountered was how to store the money movements of a user. In the end, we decided that we could keep track
of all the information of a movement using lists. Also, at first we didn't know how to localize the labels that change their text
during execution time, but we managed to do that using the getString method of the ResourceBundle class. Apart from that, we had some
problems with setting the language and ended up changing the xml file directly and having to restart the program to get the desired
result. Finally, we also solved all the problems mentioned in the review of the first sprint including not being able to commit to the
repository.

(To do this first iteration of the bet&ruin project, we've done 6 tasks, which are create questions, browse questions, Sign-up, Log-in,
create a new event and set a fee. 
We tried to do as simply as possible version of this 1st iteration. We've changed the version Juananpe, as we used a similar main menu 
aspect, just adding more options. 
Our main problem it's been that in the "Event" class the event number didn't work so we have used a 
random number creator. In the other hand, we had some problems with github, principally we had errors with the conflicts and we were not
able to solve the problems with github. Finally, setFee option was so much harder than we thought. In this option which question and which
event were selected it's been a problem for us. It also was a problem to add the fee to the database. But we finally solved those problems
by creating new atributes and saving index's of which question and which event was selected.)
